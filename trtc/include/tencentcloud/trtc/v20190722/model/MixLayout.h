2: Blank. This mode stretches the image while keeping its original aspect ratio. If the original aspect ratio is different from the target, there may be blank spaces to the top and bottom or to the left and right of the window.

3: Smart stretch. This mode is similar to the crop mode, except that it restricts cropping to 20% of the image’s width or height at most.
