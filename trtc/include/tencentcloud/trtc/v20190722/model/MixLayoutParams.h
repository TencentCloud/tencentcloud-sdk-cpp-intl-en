Floating: By default, the video of the first anchor (you can also specify an anchor) who enters the room is scaled to fill the screen. When other anchors enter the room, their videos appear smaller and are superimposed over the large video from left to right starting from the bottom of the canvas according to their room entry sequence. If the total number of videos is 17 or less, there will be four windows in each row (4 x 4); if it is greater than 17, there will be five windows in each row (5 x 5). Up to 25 videos can be displayed. A user who publishes only audio will still be displayed in one window.

Screen sharing: The video of a specified anchor occupies a larger part of the canvas on the left side (if you do not specify an anchor, the left window will display the canvas background). The videos of other anchors are smaller and are positioned on the right side. If the total number of videos is 17 or less, the small videos are positioned from top to bottom in up to two columns on the right side, with eight videos per column at most. If there are more than 17 videos, the additional videos are positioned at the bottom of the canvas from left to right. Up to 25 videos can be displayed. A user who publishes only audio will still be displayed in one window.

Grid: The videos of anchors are scaled and positioned automatically according to the total number of anchors in a room. Each video has the same size. Up to 25 videos can be displayed.

Custom: Specify the layout of videos by using the `MixLayoutList` parameter.

4: Custom

Floating: By default, the video of the first anchor (you can also specify an anchor) who enters the room is scaled to fill the screen. When other anchors enter the room, their videos appear smaller and are superimposed over the large video from left to right starting from the bottom of the canvas according to their room entry sequence.

Up to 25 videos can be displayed. A user who publishes only audio will still be displayed in one window.

Screen sharing: The video of a specified anchor occupies a larger part of the canvas on the left side (if you do not specify an anchor, the left window will display the canvas background). The videos of other anchors are smaller and are positioned on the right side. If the total number of videos is 17 or less, the small videos are positioned from top to bottom in up to two columns on the right side, with eight videos per column at most. If there are more than 17 videos, the additional videos are positioned at the bottom of the canvas from left to right. Up to 25 videos can be displayed. A user who publishes only audio will still be displayed in one window.

Grid: The videos of anchors are scaled and positioned automatically according to the total number of anchors in a room. Each video has the same size. Up to 25 videos can be displayed.

Custom: Specify the layout of videos by using the `MixLayoutList` parameter.
