Currently, `2.0` and `3.0` are supported.

This parameter is `3.0` by default starting from April 2, 2020. If it is left empty for accounts that used this API, `2.0` will be used by default.

The parameter can be set only to `3.0` for accounts that purchase the service after November 26, 2020.

Different algorithm model versions correspond to different face recognition algorithms. The 3.0 version has a better overall effect than the legacy version and is recommended.
