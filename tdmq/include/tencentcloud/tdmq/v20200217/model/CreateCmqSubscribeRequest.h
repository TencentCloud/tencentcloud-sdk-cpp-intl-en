If `FilterTag` is not configured, no matter whether `MsgTag` is configured, the subscription will receive all messages published to the topic; 2. If the array of `FilterTag` values has a value, only when at least one of the values in the array also exists in the array of `MsgTag` values (i.e., `FilterTag` and `MsgTag` have an intersection) can the subscription receive messages published to the topic; 3. If the array of `FilterTag` values has a value, but `MsgTag` is not configured, then no message published to the topic will be received, which can be considered as a special case of rule 2 as `FilterTag` and `MsgTag` do not intersect in this case. The overall design idea of rules is based on the intention of the subscriber.
