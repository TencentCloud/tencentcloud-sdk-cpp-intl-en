Notes:
1. We recommend you use FLV files as the source. Poorly interleaved MP4 files may result in playback stuttering. You can also re-interleave your MP4 files before adding them as the source.
2. Do not use private network domains or malicious URLs. CSS will block accounts that do.
3. To avoid push and playback issues, make sure the source files are properly interleaved.
4. Supported video coding formats: H.264, H.265.
5. Supported audio coding format: AAC.
6. Use small video files, preferably not longer than one hour. Large files may take a long time to load or resume after pause. Relay may fail if the time consumed exceeds 15 seconds.

Supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SRT.
Notes:
1. We recommend you use FLV files as the source. Poorly interleaved MP4 files may result in playback stuttering. You can also re-interleave your MP4 files before adding them as the source.
2. Do not use private network domains or malicious URLs. CSS will block accounts that do.
3. To avoid push and playback issues, make sure the source files are properly interleaved.
4. Supported video coding formats: H.264, H.265.
5. Supported audio coding format: AAC.
6. Use small video files, preferably not longer than one hour. Large files may take a long time to load or resume after pause. Relay may fail if the time consumed exceeds 15 seconds.
